I'll help you create a model of the Tower of Pisa with its characteristic tilt and cylindrical architecture:

```python

This program creates a simplified but recognizable model of the Tower of Pisa with these features:

1. `column_level`: Creates one level of the tower with 8 columns arranged in a circle around a central cylinder.

2. `tower_level`: Combines the columns with a floor to create one complete level.

3. `tower_of_pisa`: Assembles the complete tower with:
   - 8 levels that gradually decrease in radius as they go up
   - A wider base at the bottom
   - The characteristic lean (5.5 degrees)
   - Cylindrical architecture with columns
   - Appropriate coloring to simulate marble/stone

The tower is created from bottom to top, with each level slightly smaller than the previous one. The final step applies the famous lean using a rotation matrix. The colors are chosen to approximate the white marble appearance of the real Tower of Pisa.
